    Based on the paper:

        Omeiza, D., Speakman, S., Cintas, C., & Weldermariam, K. (2019).
        Smooth grad-cam++: An enhanced inference level visualization technique for
        deep convolutional neural network models. arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.01224.

    Implementation adapted from:

        https://github.com/frgfm/torch-cam/blob/master/torchcam/cams/gradcam.py#L164

    This implementation is modified to only support Multivariate Time Series
